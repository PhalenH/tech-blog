                I wish they were doing bwtter this season but beggers can't be
                choosers and were just going to have to live with what they do
                cause it's not like we're on the team so if they win they win
                and if they lose they lose.

                I really wish we could trade tobias for someone just better in
                any capacity but we're stuck with him for now.

                I mean where to begin with these guys, they're just not missing:
                content, apparel, business collabs, nade is a boss, the teams
                could be better, well not the lcs because they're already gross
                but like everyone else we could defintiely see some improve at
                some point but whether that actually happens or not will reamin
                to be seen. Just gonna wait and see what unfolds, especially
                with the valorant roster.
